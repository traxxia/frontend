# Kickstart the Project

Welcome to the **Kickstart the Project** guide. This section explains how to initiate the project phase from the strategic analysis tab.

## 1. What is Kickstart?

The "Kickstart" action is the bridge between strategic analysis and project execution. It transitions the business from the **Analysis phase** to the **Projects phase**.

When you kickstart projects:
*   The business card turns **blue** on the Dashboard, indicating it is now in the Projects phase
*   The **Projects tab** becomes visible and active
*   You can begin creating and managing strategic projects

## 2. Kickstart Projects Button

For **Company Admins**, the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab includes a **"Kickstart Projects"** button.

Clicking this button:
1. Transitions the business to the **Projects phase**
2. Opens the Projects tab automatically
3. Allows you to create your first project

> [!NOTE]
> The Kickstart button is only available to **Company Admins**. Collaborators and Viewers cannot kickstart the project phase.

## 3. Who can Kickstart Projects?

*   **Company Admins:** Only users with the Company Admin role can see and click the "Kickstart Projects" button in the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab.

This ensures that the transition from analysis to execution is made by those with the appropriate organizational oversight.

## 4. After Kickstarting

Once you have kickstarted the project phase:
