# Kickstart the Project

Welcome to the **Kickstart the Project** guide. This section provides a comprehensive walkthrough for initiating and setting up a new project within the Traxxia ecosystem.

## 1. Project Kick-off Definition

The "Kickstart" phase is the critical first step in your project lifecycle. It serves to:
*   **Define Objectives:** Clearly state what the project aims to achieve.
*   **Align Stakeholders:** Ensure everyone involved understands the goals and scope.
*   **Establish Baseline:** Set the initial parameters against which progress will be measured.

In Traxxia, kicking off a project initializes the workspace and prepares the necessary data structures for subsequent analysis.

## 2. Kickstart Projects

For **Company Admins**, the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab includes a powerful **"Kickstart Projects"** feature.

Clicking this button automatically:
1.  **Scans** your generated recommendations (from PESTEL, Porter's, etc.).
2.  **Identifies** immediate actions and strategic initiatives.
3.  **Creates** draft entries in your **Projects** tab.

This allows you to instantly move from reading a report to assigning tasks and tracking progress in the Project Management module.

## 3. Who can Kickstart Projects?

The **"Kickstart Projects"** automation is a powerful strategic tool reserved for specific roles:

*   **Company Admins:** Only users with the Company Admin role can see and click the "Kickstart Projects" button in the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab.

This ensures that strategic initiatives are converted into projects by those with the appropriate organizational oversight.

## 4. Post-Kickstart Actions

Once you have kicked started your projects, you are ready for the next steps:

1.  **Review Drafts:** If you used the automatic Kickstart button, go to your **Projects** tab to see the newly created draft entries.
2.  **Strategic Analysis:** specific SWOT/PESTEL analysis applied to this project.
3.  **Questionnaire:** Run the AI questionnaire to gather deep insights.

Select your new project from the dashboard to begin these activities.
