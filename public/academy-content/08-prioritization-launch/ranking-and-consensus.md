# Ranking & Consensus

The prioritization module is a structured, Org Admin-led event that aligns the entire team on what to launch next.

## 1. Initializing the Workflow
The process begins when the Org Admin clicks **"Start Prioritization Workflow"**.
-   **Locking**: The system locks all project creation and deletion.
-   **Transitions**: All finalized projects move to the **"In Prioritization"** state.
-   **Notification**: Every collaborator is invited to provide their input.

## 2. Collaborative Ranking
Collaborators access the Prioritization Dashboard to rank projects:
-   **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder projects to reflect your priority (1 = High, N = Low).
-   **Rationale**: You must add a comment or rationale for your rankings.
-   **Comparison**: See a **Side-by-Side Matrix** of all users' rankings to identify where the team is in agreement (Consensus) or conflict (Divergence).

## 3. Finalization & Overrides
The Org Admin reviews the team's suggested rankings but maintains final decision rights.
-   **Final Ranking**: The Admin sets the "Official" priority order.
-   **Max Project setting**: The Admin sets a numeric limit (e.g., "Top 3").
    -   Projects 1-3: Marked as **Active**.
    -   Projects 4+: Marked as **Backlog**.

## 4. The Priority Review Dashboard
A visual matrix shows:
-   **Mean Priority**: The average rank from the team.
-   **Priority Spread**: How much users disagreed on a project.
-   **Consensus Indicators**: Badges like "High Agreement" or "Divergent Views."

## 5. Locking the Results
Clicking **"Lock Prioritization"** freezes the rankings.
-   **State**: Projects move to the **Prioritized** state (Purple badge).
-   **Transition**: A "Proceed to Grooming" button appears, prompting the team to move to Module 2 for technical execution planning.

**Why this process?** It replaces opaque decision-making with a visible, data-driven consensus model that ensures the leadership team is aligned before spending resources.
