# Ranking & Launching

Before a project moves from a "Draft" to an "Active" roadmap item, it must undergo the **Consensus Ranking** process. This ensures that only the highest-value projects are executed.

## 1. The Ranking Process
Ranking is a collaborative effort:
1.  **Individual Ranking**: Every assigned collaborator (and the Admin) ranks each project based on their perspective of Impact, Effort, and Risk.
2.  **Consensus**: Traxxia aggregates these individual rankings to show a "Consensus View," identifying where the team agrees and where there is misalignment.
3.  **Locking Rankings**: Once the team is satisfied, the Admin can lock the rankings to finalize the priority list.

## 2. Launching a Project
After rankings are finalized, the Admin can select the top projects and click **"Launch"**.

### What happens during Launch?
-   **Status Change**: The project moves from **Draft** to **Active**.
-   **Strategic Commitment**: The organization officially commits resources to executing this initiative.
-   **Active Dashboard**: The project will now show up in the "Active Projects" section of your business dashboard.

## 3. Re-prioritization
Strategy is not static. You can always revisit your rankings as new information becomes available or if the organization's goals shift.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A project must be ranked before it can be launched. This prevents "gut-feel" decisions from bypassing the data-driven process.
