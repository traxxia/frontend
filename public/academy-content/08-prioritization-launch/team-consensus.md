# Team Consensus

Achieving team consensus is a critical step in the Traxxia prioritization workflow. This article explains how the system calculates and displays team alignment.

## Understanding Consensus

When multiple collaborators rank projects, the system analyzes the distribution of ranks to identify where the team is in agreement and where opinions differ.

### Key Metrics

1.  **Mean Priority**: The weighted average of all collaborator rankings.
2.  **Priority Spread**: A measure of divergence. A low spread indicates high consensus, while a high spread means the team has conflicting views.
3.  **Agreement Levels**:
    *   **High Consensus**: Clear alignment on project value.
    *   **Divergent Views**: Significant variance in rankings, suggesting the need for further discussion.

## The Consensus Matrix

The Consensus Matrix provides a side-by-side comparison of all collaborator inputs. 

- **Rows**: Projects currently in prioritization.
- **Columns**: Collaborators and their assigned ranks.
- **Visual Cues**: Color-coded indicators highlight projects with the most disagreement.

## Moving to Finalization

Once the team consensus is reviewed, the Org Admin can proceed to finalize the official project rankings, taking the team's collective data into account.
