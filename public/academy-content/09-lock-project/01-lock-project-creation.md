# Lock Project Creation

Understanding how and when to lock project creation is essential for moving the business from the drafting phase into the prioritization phase.

## 1. Access Control: Who Can Lock?

Locking project creation is restricted to:
*   **Company Admins**
*   **Super Admins**

Standard collaborators and viewers cannot lock project creation.

## 2. What Locking Does

When a Company Admin clicks **"Lock Project Creation"**:

1. The AI ranking engine is called automatically to rank all current projects
2. AI rankings are saved and become visible to all collaborators
3. No new projects can be created (the "New Project" button is hidden)
4. The business status moves from **"Draft"** to **"Prioritizing"**

This signals to the team that the project list is finalized and it's time to rank.

## 3. Before Locking

Before you lock project creation, ensure the following:
*   **All Projects Created:** The full list of strategic initiatives has been entered
*   **Stakeholder Approval:** Key stakeholders have reviewed the project list
*   **Team Assembled:** Collaborators who will rank projects have been invited

## 4. After Locking

Once project creation is locked:
*   **AI Rankings Generated:** The AI ranking engine runs automatically and ranks all projects
*   **Collaborators Can Rank:** All collaborators can now see the projects and submit their manual rankings
*   **Business Status:** Moves to **"Prioritizing"**

> [!NOTE] Locking project creation does not prevent editing existing projects. Collaborators can still update project details — only creating new projects is blocked.
