# Finalize Prioritization

The "Finalize Prioritization" action marks the transition from active ranking to a closed state, ready for launch.

## 1. Access Control

This critical action is restricted to:
*   **Company Admins**
*   **Super Admins**

## 2. Before Finalization

Before clicking the Finalize button, ensure:

*   **All Rankings Submitted:** All collaborators have locked their rankings (check the Collaborator Progress badge — it should show all users locked, e.g., "3 / 3" with a green checkmark)
*   **Analysis Complete:** SWOT and PESTEL analyses have been reviewed
*   **Consensus Reached:** There is general agreement on the project priorities

## 3. After Finalization

Once finalized:
*   **Business Status**: Moves to **"Prioritized"**
*   **Rankings Locked**: No further ranking changes can be made
*   **Launch Ready**: The Launch button becomes available for selecting and launching projects

## 4. Business Status Flow

The business moves through these statuses during the project phase:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Projects being created, rankings open |
| **Prioritizing** | Project creation locked, collaborators ranking |
| **Prioritized** | Rankings finalized, ready to launch |
| **Launched** | Projects have been launched |

> [!TIP]
> You can launch projects directly without going through the full finalize flow if you are launching a single project — single project launches bypass ranking requirements entirely.
