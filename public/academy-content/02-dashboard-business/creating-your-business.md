# Business Overview

The Dashboard is where your journey truly begins. From here, you can see all your registered businesses and their current progress.

## 1. Understanding Workspace Limits
A "Workspace" in Traxxia represents a single Business Entity. The number of workspaces you can maintain is governed by your plan:
-   **Essential**: Hard cap of **1 Workspace**.
-   **Advanced**: Hard cap of **3 Workspaces**.

> [!NOTE] These limits are enforced at the backend level. Attempting to add a second business in Essential or a fourth in Advanced will trigger an upgrade or contact-sales prompt.

## 2. Anti-Abuse & Workspace Integrity
To maintain the integrity of our workspace management system, Traxxia implements specific safety rules:
-   **Deletion Rate-Limit**: Users are restricted to **1 workspace deletion per 30-day period**. This prevents bypassing workspace limits through frequent "delete and replace" cycles.
-   **Soft Deletion**: When you delete a workspace, it is **soft-deleted/archived** internally. This allows for auditing and internal tracking while freeing up your workspace slot.

## 3. Creating a New Business
To create a business, click the **"New Business"** button on the dashboard. You will need to provide the Business Name, Description, and Industry.

> [!TIP] If you have already reached your limit, consider **Archiving** your current business to preserve its data before starting a new one (if your plan allows for multiple slots).
