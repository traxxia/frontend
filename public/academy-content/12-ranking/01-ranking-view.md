# Ranking View Explained

The Ranking View is a powerful tool for visualising the priorities of your projects based on team input and AI analysis.

## Accessing the Ranking View

In the Projects tab, click the **Ranking** tab at the top to switch from the project card grid to the ranking interface.

Within the Ranking view, you have two panels:

- **Rank Projects** — Your personal ranking panel where you drag-and-drop projects to set your priority order
- **Rankings View** — A side-by-side view of all collaborators' rankings

## 1. Rank Projects Panel

The **Rank Projects** panel lets you manually set the priority order for all projects.

*   **Drag-and-drop** projects to reorder them
*   Click **Save Rankings** to persist your order
*   After saving, AI re-ranking is automatically triggered in the background

## 2. AI Ranking

After you save manual rankings, Traxxia automatically calls the AI ranking engine. The AI ranking appears alongside your manual ranking so you can compare:

- **Manual Rank**: Your team's collective judgment
- **AI Rank**: The AI's objective assessment based on strategic alignment and potential impact

> [!TIP] Use the AI ranking as a benchmark. If the AI ranks a project much higher than your team, it may be an overlooked gem. If the AI ranks it much lower, it may be driven by bias rather than data.

## 3. Rankings View (Team Rankings)

The **Rankings View** shows all collaborators' rankings side by side, allowing admins to see where there is consensus and where there is disagreement.

*   **Collaborator Progress**: Admins see a badge showing how many collaborators have locked their rankings (e.g., "2 / 3")
*   A green checkmark appears when all collaborators have locked their rankings

## 4. Locking Your Rankings

Once you are satisfied with your ranking, **saving your rankings** locks them in. The system tracks which collaborators have submitted their rankings.

> [!IMPORTANT] For **multiple project launches**, all collaborators must lock their rankings before the admin can proceed to launch. For a **single project launch**, rankings are bypassed and the project is automatically ranked as #1.

## 5. Consensus

"Consensus" measures the level of agreement among your team members.
*   **High Consensus:** Most team members ranked the item similarly.
*   **Low Consensus:** There is significant disagreement (polarization).

## 6. Color Indicators

*   **Green:** High Priority / Strong Agreement.
*   **Yellow:** Medium Priority / Moderate Agreement.
*   **Red:** Low Priority / Weak Agreement / High Contention.
