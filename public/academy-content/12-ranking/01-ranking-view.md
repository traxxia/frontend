# Ranking View Explained

The Ranking View is a powerful tool for visualising the priorities of your project based on team input.

## 1. Components of the View

*   **List Layout:** Items are displayed in descending order of importance.
*   **Rank Score:** A numerical value derived from the aggregate votes of all participants.
*   **Heatmap:** Visual intensity indicators (e.g., darker shades for higher priority) to quickly identify critical items.

## 2. Comparing with AI Ranking

You can toggle the **"Show AI Comparison"** switch to see how your team's manual ranking compares with the AI's objective assessment. Diff indicators (up/down arrows) show where the AI agrees or disagrees with the team.

## 3. Consensus

"Consensus" measures the level of agreement among your team members.
*   **High Consensus:** Most team members ranked the item similarly.
*   **Low Consensus:** There is significant disagreement (polarization).

## 4. Color Indicators

*   **Green:** High Priority / Strong Agreement.
*   **Yellow:** Medium Priority / Moderate Agreement.
*   **Red:** Low Priority / Weak Agreement / High Contention.
