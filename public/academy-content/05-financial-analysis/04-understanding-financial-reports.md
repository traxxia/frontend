## Reading the Reports

### Profitability Analysis

**What it shows**: How efficiently your business generates profit

**Key Metrics**:

| Metric | Formula | What it Means | Good Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | Pricing power and production efficiency | >40% (varies by industry) |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Revenue | Core business profitability | >15% |
| **Net Margin** | Net Income / Revenue | Bottom-line profitability | >10% |
| **ROA** | Net Income / Total Assets | Asset utilization efficiency | >5% |
| **ROE** | Net Income / Equity | Return to shareholders | >15% |

![Profitability metrics dashboard with trend charts](/academy-screenshots/financial-analysis/profitability.png)

**Interpretation Tips**:
- ✅ **Improving margins** → Business becoming more efficient
- ⚠️ **Declining margins** → Cost pressure or pricing challenges
- 📊 **Compare to industry** → Are you above or below average?

> [!TIP]
> Focus on trends over time, not just absolute numbers. A 5% improvement in margin can be more significant than a single high-margin quarter!

### Growth Tracker

**What it shows**: How fast your business is expanding

**Key Metrics**:

| Metric | Calculation | Insight |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Revenue Growth** | (Current Revenue - Prior Revenue) / Prior Revenue | Top-line expansion |
| **Profit Growth** | (Current Profit - Prior Profit) / Prior Profit | Bottom-line expansion |
| **Expense Growth** | Year-over-year expense changes | Cost control |
| **CAGR** | Compound Annual Growth Rate | Smoothed multi-year growth |

![Revenue growth chart with year-over-year comparison](/academy-screenshots/financial-analysis/cost-financial.png)

**What's Good?**:
- Revenue growing faster than expenses
- Consistent quarter-over-quarter growth
- Growth rate above industry average
- Profit margins maintained during growth

**Warning Signs**:
- Revenue growth slowing
- Expenses growing faster than revenue
- Erratic/unpredictable growth patterns
- Growth requiring excessive capital

### Liquidity & Efficiency

**What it shows**: Can you pay your bills? Are you using resources efficiently?

**Key Ratios**:

| Ratio | Formula | Good Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Current Ratio** | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | 1.5 - 3.0 | Short-term solvency |
| **Quick Ratio** | (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities | 1.0 - 2.0 | Immediate liquidity |
| **Cash Conversion** | Days to convert operations to cash | Lower is better | Operating efficiency |
| **Inventory Turnover** | COGS / Average Inventory | Higher is better | Inventory efficiency |

![Liquidity metrics gauge chart](/academy-screenshots/financial-analysis/cost-financial.png)

**Interpretation**:
- ✅ **Current Ratio > 1.5** → Can cover short-term debts
- ⚠️ **Current Ratio < 1.0** → Liquidity concerns
- ✅ **Quick Ratio > 1.0** → Good cash position
- ⚠️ **Increasing Cash Conversion** → Tying up more cash

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A very high current ratio (>4.0) might indicate inefficient use of assets! Balance is key.

### Leverage & Risk

**What it shows**: How much debt you're using and if it's sustainable

**Key Metrics**:

| Metric | Formula | Safe Range | Risk Level |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Total Equity | <1.0 | Low |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Total Equity | 1.0-2.0 | Moderate |
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Total Equity | >2.0 | High |
| **Interest Coverage** | EBIT / Interest Expense | >3.0 | Comfortable |

![Debt and risk assessment visualization](/academy-screenshots/financial-analysis/cost-financial.png)

**Interpretation**:
- ✅ **Debt-to-Equity < 1.0** → Conservative capital structure
- ⚠️ **Debt-to-Equity > 2.0** → Aggressive leverage, higher risk
- ✅ **Interest Coverage > 3.0** → Easily covering debt payments
- ⚠️ **Interest Coverage < 1.5** → Debt servicing challenges
