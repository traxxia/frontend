## File Replacement

### Replacing vs. Updating:

**Replace** when:

- Complete data corrections
- Switching to better data source

**Don't Replace** - just add when:
- Want to preserve historical analyses
- Minor corrections only
- Unfortunately, Traxxia doesn't support "append-only" yet - replacement is the only option

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I upload multiple files?**  
A: Not simultaneously. Upload one template at a time. If you have P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow, upload the most relevant one first.

**Q: What if I only have partial data?**  
A: Upload what you have. Some analyses may be limited, but partial data provides value.

**Q: Can I edit data after uploading?**  
A: Not directly. Download, edit the file, and re-upload to replace.

**Q: How long is the file stored?**  
A: Until you delete the business or replace the file.

**Q: What format should numbers be in?**  
A: Standard numbers (e.g., 500000 or 500,000). Don't include currency symbols in cells (unless template has them).
