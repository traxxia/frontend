# Tracking Your Progress

Stay on top of your questionnaire completion with Traxxia's progress tracking features. This guide shows you how to monitor where you are and what's left to complete.

## Progress Overview

The Traxxia questionnaire is divided into **three phases**:

| Phase | Focus | Typical Questions | Unlocked When |
|-------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1** | Business fundamentals, market | ~15-20 questions | Immediately |
| **Phase 2** | Strategy, positioning, customers | ~15-20 questions | After Phase 1 complete |
| **Phase 3** | Operations, resources, financials | ~15-20 questions | After Phase 2 complete |

> [!NOTE]
> Traxxia uses sequential unlocking—complete each phase to unlock the next.

## Tracking Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Set Milestones

Break questionnaire into manageable chunks:

**Good approach**:
- Day 1: Complete Phase 1 (1-2 hours)
- Day 2-3: Answer Phase 2 (1-2 hours)
- Day 4: Complete Phase 3 (1-2 hours)

**Avoid**:
- Rushing through all phases in one sitting
- Leaving partially answered phases for weeks
- Answering without proper thought/research

### 2. Use the Save & Continue Feature

- Progress auto-saves after each question
- You can exit and return anytime
- No need to complete entire phase in one session

- Verify questions weren't validation errors
- Log out and back in
- Contact support with screenshots

### Phase Won't Unlock

**Problem**: Completed previous phase but next phase locked

**Possible causes**:
- Required questions still unanswered
- Validation errors present
- Previous phase not finalized

**Solutions**:
1. Return to previous phase
2. Look for red error indicators
3. Check "Required" filter
4. Answer all mandatory questions
5. Click "Complete Phase" explicitly

### Progress Disappeared

**Problem**: Previously answered questions now show as incomplete

**This shouldn't happen** - contact support immediately if:
- Answers vanish
- Progress resets unexpectedly
- Phases lock again

> [!WARNING]
> If you experience data loss, stop answering questions and contact support at `support@traxxia.com` immediately.

## Progress Across Multiple Businesses

### Managing Multiple Questionnaires

If you have several businesses:

**Dashboard view**:
- See all businesses with progress bars
- **Sort by** completion percentage
- **Filter** by status (Prioritizing, Prioritized)
- Prioritize which to complete first

![Dashboard showing multiple businesses with varying progress](ALT_TEXT_PLACEHOLDER)

**Best practices**:
- Focus on one questionnaire at a time
- Complete highest-priority business first
- Don't start too many simultaneously
- Use tags/notes to track priority
