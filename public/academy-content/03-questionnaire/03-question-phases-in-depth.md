- "Describe your primary customer segments in detail."
- "What are your top 3 revenue streams, and what percentage does each contribute?"
- "What are your biggest operational challenges?"

### Completion Time
**Estimate**: 2-4 hours (can be done across multiple sessions)

### Unlock Condition:
Complete all Initial phase questions

### Critical Milestone:
Completing Essential phase unlocks the **financial upload decision point**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot proceed to Advanced questions until:
> 1. All Essential questions are answered (or strategically skipped)
> 2. You make a decision about financial data upload (upload or skip)

---

## Financial Upload Decision Point

### When It Appears:
After completing **100% of Essential questions**, the AI prompts:

```
"Great! You've completed the Essential phase. Would you like to upload 
financial data for enhanced analysis, or skip and continue with the 
remaining questions?"
```

### Your Options:

#### Option A: Upload Financial Data ✅

**Benefits**:
- Unlock financial analysis frameworks
- Get profitability, growth, and risk metrics
- More accurate strategic recommendations
- Enhanced competitive benchmarking

**What to Upload**:
- Excel files based on Traxxia templates
- Financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
- Historical data (1-3 years recommended)

**File Requirements**:

- Must match Traxxia template structure
- AI validates template before accepting

**When to Choose This**:
- You have financial data ready
- Want comprehensive financial analysis

#### Option B: Skip Upload ⏭️

**Impact**:
- Proceed directly to Advanced questions

**When to Choose This**:
- Don't have financial data available
- Early-stage startup without financials
- Privacy/confidentiality concerns
- Want to complete questionnaire first

> [!TIP]

### How to Decide:

**Choose Upload If:**
- ✅ You have 1+ years of financial data

## Question Severity Levels

Within each phase, questions have severity ratings:

**Examples**: "What are your primary revenue streams?"
**Recommendation**: Never skip unless truly not applicable

### 🟡 Important
**Impact**: Significantly enhances analysis quality
**Examples**: "Describe your competitive advantages"
**Recommendation**: Answer if at all possible

### 🟢 Optional
**Impact**: Provides additional context and depth
**Examples**: "What awards or recognitions has your business received?"
**Recommendation**: Answer if information is readily available

> [!NOTE]
> The AI doesn't currently display severity levels in the interface, but it uses them internally to prioritize which questions to ask first.

## Strategic Skipping

### When to Skip Questions

**Valid Reasons**:
- Question truly not applicable to your business
- Information not currently available
- Requires research you'll do later
- Sensitive/confidential data you can't share

**Poor Reasons**:
- Question seems hard
- Don't feel like answering
- Want to finish quickly
- Think it doesn't matter

### Impact of Skipping

**Skipping Initial Questions**:
- May create gaps in basic understanding
- Could affect relevance of later questions
- Minimal skip - high impact per question

**Skipping Essential Questions**:
- Directly reduces strategic analysis quality
- May produce generic frameworks
- Significant gap in specific areas (e.g., skip all competitive questions → weak competitive analysis)

**Skipping Advanced Questions**:
- Limits long-term strategic recommendations
- Reduces innovation insights
- Least immediate impact on core frameworks

### Best Practice:
Aim for 90%+ completion rate, especially in Essential phase
