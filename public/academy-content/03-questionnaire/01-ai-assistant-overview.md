### 2. Your Answer

Type your response in the text input field and press Enter or click Send.

**Tips for Good Answers**:
- Be specific and detailed
- Provide context and examples
- Avoid vague or single-word answers
- Include relevant numbers/metrics when applicable

---

### 3. AI Validation

After you submit an answer, the AI validates it:

**Scenario A: Answer is Sufficient**
- ✅ AI accepts the answer
- Moves to next question
- Progress updates automatically

**Scenario B: Answer Needs More Detail**
- 🔄 AI asks a follow-up question
- Requests specific clarification
- You provide additional information
- Process repeats until answer is complete

![AI follow-up question example](/academy-screenshots/questionnaire/first-question.png)

---

## AI Follow-Up Questions

### Why Follow-Ups Happen

The AI requests more information when answers are:
- Too brief or vague
- Missing critical context
- Unclear or ambiguous
- Lacking specific examples

### Example Exchange:

**Initial Question**: "Describe your target market."

**Your Answer**: "Small businesses"

**AI Follow-Up**: "Could you provide more details about these small businesses? For example, what industry are they in, what size (revenue/employees), and what specific problems do they face?"

**Better Answer**: "Our target market is dental practices with 2-10 dentists, generating $500K-$2M in annual revenue. They struggle with patient scheduling inefficiencies, high no-show rates, and administrative overhead."

---

## Question Modules

Questions are grouped into strategic modules:

| Module | Focus Area | Example Questions |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Vision & Values** | Mission, purpose, culture | "What is your business's core mission?" |
| **Competitive Landscape** | Competitors, differentiation | "Who are your top 3 competitors?" |
| **Market Dynamics** | Market size, trends, growth | "What is your addressable market size?" |
| **Business Model** | Revenue, pricing, channels | "What are your primary revenue streams?" |
| **Customer Analysis** | Segments, needs, behavior | "Describe your ideal customer profile." |
| **Value Chain** | Operations, suppliers, partners | "What are your key operational processes?" |
