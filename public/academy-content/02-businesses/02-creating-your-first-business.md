## Common Creation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Business Name Too Long

**Error**: "Business name cannot exceed 20 characters"

**Solution**:
- Use abbreviations where appropriate
- Remove unnecessary words
- Focus on core concept

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Strategic Initiative for Market Expansion in LATAM Region" (60 chars)
- ✅ "LATAM Expansion Q2 2024" (23 chars) - still too long!
- ✅ "LATAM Market Entry" (18 chars) ✓

### Mistake 2: Starting with Number/Symbol

**Error**: "Business name must start with a letter"

**Examples**:
- ❌ "2024 Marketing Plan"
- ❌ "#1 Priority Initiative"
- ✅ "Marketing Plan 2024"
- ✅ "Priority Initiative 1"

### Mistake 3: Empty Required Fields

**Error**: "Business name cannot be empty" or "Purpose is required"

**Solution**:
- Fill all required fields before submitting
- Don't leave name or purpose blank

### Mistake 4: Vague Purpose

**Not an Error, But...**:
- Generic purposes make it hard to guide strategic analysis
- Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish
