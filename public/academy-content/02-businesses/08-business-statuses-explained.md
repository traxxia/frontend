# Business Statuses Explained

Traxxia automatically tracks your business's progress through different stages. Understanding these statuses helps you know where you are in the strategic analysis journey.

## Overview of Business Statuses

Traxxia uses four primary business statuses:

| Status | Icon | Meaning | Typical Duration |
|--------|------|---------|------------------|
| **Prioritizing** | 🔄 | Questionnaire in progress | Days to weeks |
| **Prioritized** | ✅ | Analysis complete, ready for review | Ongoing |
| **Reprioritizing** | 🔁 | Updating questionnaire responses | Hours to days |
| **Launched** | 🚀 | Business is active/implemented | Indefinite |

> [!NOTE]
> Business statuses update automatically based on your actions—you don't manually set them (except for "Launched").

## Status Lifecycle

### The Standard Journey

```
[Create Business] → Prioritizing → Prioritized → (Launched)
                          ↓             ↑
                     Reprioritizing ----
```

**Typical flow**:
1. Create new business → **Prioritizing**
2. Complete questionnaire → **Prioritized**
3. Refine answers → **Reprioritizing**
4. Finalize updates → **Prioritized**
5. Implement business → **Launched** (manual)

**Solutions**:
