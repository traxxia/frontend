# Editing Business Information

After creating a business, you may need to update its information as your understanding evolves or as circumstances change. This guide shows you how to edit existing business profiles.

## When to Edit Business Information

Common reasons to update a business profile:

- Business name or description needs refinement
- Country or industry information changes
- You've gained new insights through the questionnaire
- Correcting typos or mistakes
- Updating business status or stage
- Adding or modifying context for strategic analysis

> [!TIP]
> It's better to keep business information current rather than creating duplicate businesses with updated details.

## Accessing Business Edit Mode

1. Navigate to your **Dashboard**
2. Locate the business card you want to edit
3. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) on the business card
