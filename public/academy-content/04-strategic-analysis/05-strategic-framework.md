# The S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C Framework

The **S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C** tab in Traxxia Academy is your comprehensive command center for turning insights into action. While the "6 C's" provide the analysis, this framework provides the roadmap. It breaks down your business strategy into 9 actionable pillars across 3 core blocks.

![Strategy Block Overview](/academy-screenshots/strategic-analysis/strategy-block.png)

## Overview

The framework is designed to bridge the gap between "knowing" (Analysis) and "doing" (Execution). It is divided into three logical blocks:

1.  **Strategy Block (S.T.R)**: Defines **Direction & Positioning**. Where are we going and what do we need?
2.  **Execution Block (A.T.E)**: Focuses on **Implementation & Monitoring**. How do we get there?
3.  **Sustainability Block (G.I.C)**: Ensures **Long-term Reinforcement**. How do we stay there?

Each block contains 3 pillars, forming the acronym **S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C**.
