# Porter's Five Forces Analysis

Porter's Five Forces is a strategic framework that helps you understand the competitive dynamics of your industry. Traxxia automatically generates this analysis based on your questionnaire responses.

## What is Porter's Five Forces?

Developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, this framework analyzes five key forces that determine industry competitiveness and profitability:

1. **Threat of New Entrants** - How easy is it for new competitors to enter?
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** - How much power do suppliers have?
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers** - How much power do customers have?
4. **Threat of Substitutes** - How easily can customers switch to alternatives?
5. **Competitive Rivalry** - How intense is the competition among existing players?

> [!NOTE]
> Porter's Five Forces helps you understand not just who your competitors are, but the overall structure of competition in your industry.
