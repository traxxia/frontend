# Reprioritization & Re-editing

Even after a project is launched, agility is key. The Reprioritization workflow allows for controlled changes to the project plan.

## 1. The Process

1.  **Request:** A team member flags a need for change.
2.  **Unlock:** The Admin explicitly grants "Reprioritization Mode" access to the project.

*Navigate to the User Management section to locate the project member.*

*Give the specific project access to "Reprioritization Mode" to enable editing capabilities.*

3.  **Edit:** Selected users can modify rankings, add new items, or archive obsolete ones.
4.  **Re-Finalize:** The project goes through a streamlined approval process to return to "Live" status.

## 2. Who Can be Granted Access?

Admins can granularity grant editing rights during this phase:
*   **Full Edit Access:** Can add/remove items (typically Owners).
*   **Rerank Access:** Can only adjust priorities of existing items (typically key stakeholders).

*Select the appropriate permission level (Full Edit or Rerank Only) for each stakeholder.*

This ensures that the project remains stable while adapting to new information.
