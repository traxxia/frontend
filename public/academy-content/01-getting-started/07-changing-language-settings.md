# Changing Language Settings

Traxxia supports multiple languages to help you work in your preferred language. This guide explains how to change your language preferences.

## Available Languages

Traxxia currently supports:
- **English** (Default)
- **LATAM** (Latin American Spanish)

> [!NOTE]
> More languages will be added in future updates based on user demand.

## Changing Your Language

### Method 1: From the Login Page

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Look for the **Language Preferences** dropdown in the top-right corner
3. Choose your preferred language from the dropdown
4. Click **"Apply"**

## What Changes When You Switch Languages?

When you change your language preference, the following elements will update:

| Element | Changes | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Menu Labels** | ✅ Yes | All navigation menus translate |
| **Button Text** | ✅ Yes | All buttons and actions |
| **Form Labels** | ✅ Yes | Input field labels and placeholders |
| **Error Messages** | ✅ Yes | Validation and error notifications |
| **Help Text** | ✅ Yes | Tooltips and guidance |
| **Your Content** | ❌ No | Business names, questionnaire answers remain unchanged |
| **AI Responses** | Partial | AI adapts to your language where possible |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Content you've already created (business names, descriptions, questionnaire answers) will **not** be automatically translated. Only the interface language changes.

## Language-Specific Features

### English Users

## Troubleshooting

### Language Not Changing

**Problem**: Selected a new language but interface didn't update

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh the page** - Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+R` (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached content prevents updates
3. **Check saved settings** - Return to settings to verify language was saved
4. **Log out and back in** - As a last resort, try logging out

### Partial Translation

**Problem**: Some parts of the interface are still in English

**This is normal if**:
- New features may not be fully translated yet
- Technical error messages may remain in English
- Third-party integrations may only support English

> [!NOTE]
> If you notice missing translations, please report them to Traxxia support so we can improve language coverage.

### Mixed Language Content

**Problem**: Interface shows mix of languages

**Cause**: Browser language settings may conflict with Traxxia settings

**Solution**:
1. Check your browser's language preference
2. Ensure Traxxia language setting matches your preference
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Reload the application

## Team Collaboration Across Languages

If your team uses different languages:

- Each user can set their own language preference
- Business data remains consistent across all languages
- Comments and notes are not translated automatically
- Consider establishing a team language standard for shared content

> [!TIP]
> For teams working across languages, we recommend:
> - Using English for business names (improves searchability)
> - Documenting language preferences in team guidelines
> - Being mindful when sharing screenshots or instructions

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Early** - Set your language during initial setup
2. **Stay Consistent** - Avoid frequent changes to prevent confusion
3. **Team Alignment** - Coordinate with your team on language standards
4. **Update Training** - If switching languages, review training materials in your new language
