## Account Options

### Standard Registration
By default, you are creating a new Organization Owner account. This gives you full control to invite others and manage your business subscription.

### Invitation Links
If you received an invitation link via email, the Registration Page might look slightly different or pre-fill some information to link you to an existing organization.

## Common Questions

**Why do I need a Company Name?**
Traxxia centers around business analysis. Even for individual use, we group your data under a "Company" or "Organization" entity.

**Can I change my email later?**
Yes, you can update your profile settings after logging in.
