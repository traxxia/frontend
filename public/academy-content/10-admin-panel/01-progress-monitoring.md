# Admin Panel Control

For **Super Admins**, Traxxia offers a powerful **Admin Panel** to monitor the progress of all organizations and users within the platform.

## 1. Monitoring Progress
The Admin Panel provides a bird's-eye view of:
-   **Company Activity**: See which companies are actively completing questionnaires and launching projects.
-   **User Engagement**: Monitor login frequency and platform usage.
-   **Plan Distribution**: Track how many users are on Essential vs. Advanced plans.

## 2. Business Management
Super Admins can drill down into specific businesses to:
-   Check their current strategic progress.
-   Monitor the health of the project portfolio.
-   Ensure that the organizational data is properly synchronized.

## 3. Security & Governance
This panel also serves as the control center for system-wide settings, user authorization, and high-level platform health metrics.

> [!NOTE] Regular users and even Company Admins do not have access to the Admin Panel. It is strictly for Traxxia platform administrators.
