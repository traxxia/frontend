# Admin Panel Control

The **Admin Panel** provides a centralized control center for both Platform (Super Admins) and Organization (Company Admins) management.

## 1. Overview of Panel Tabs
Depending on your role, you will see a subset of these specialized tabs:

-   **Companies / Company**: View and manage organizational profiles and high-level health metrics.
-   **Businesses**: Manage individual workspaces (Business Entities). Monitor current strategic progress across your portfolio.
-   **User Management**: The primary hub for inviting collaborators, assigning business access, and monitoring team activity.
-   **Access Management**: (Company Admin only) Granularly control permissions for collaborators across specific projects and businesses.
-   **User History**: A chronological record of strategic contributions—who completed what phase and when.
-   **Audit Trail**: A secure log targeting platform-wide changes, logins, and sensitive administrative settings for compliance.
-   **Questions**: (Super Admin only) The interface to add/edit the AI Questionnaire structure and strategic frameworks.
-   **Subscription**: Manage your tier (Essential vs. Advanced), payment methods, and monitor collaborator/workspace usage limits.

## 2. Executive Portfolio Audit
Admins can drill down into any project state to read **Mandatory Justifications** from the Decision Log, providing full transparency into the "why" behind every pivot or cancellation.

> [!NOTE] Access to the Admin Panel is restricted based on user role. Collaborators do not have access to these management functions.
