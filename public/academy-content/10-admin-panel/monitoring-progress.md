# Super Admin Panel Control

The **Super Admin Panel** provides a centralized control center for both Platform (Super Admins) and Organization (Company Admins) management.

## 1. Overview of Super Admin Panel Tabs
Depending on your role, you will see a subset of these specialized tabs:

-   **Companies**: View and manage organizational profiles and high-level health metrics.
-   **Businesses**: Manage individual workspaces (Business Entities). Monitor current strategic progress across your Site.
-   **User Management**: The primary hub for viewing users, and filter by roles.
-   **User History**: A chronological record of strategic contributions—who completed what phase and when.
-   **Audit Trail**: A secure log targeting platform-wide changes, logins, and sensitive administrative settings for compliance.
-   **Questions**: (Super Admin only) The interface to add/edit the AI Questionnaire structure and strategic frameworks.
