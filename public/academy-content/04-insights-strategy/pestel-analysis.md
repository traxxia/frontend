# PESTEL Analysis

PESTEL Analysis is a strategic framework used to evaluate the macro-environmental factors that can impact an organization. Traxxia's AI identifies these external forces to help you anticipate trends and mitigate risks.

2. **Economic**: Economic growth rates, interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation.
3. **Social**: Demographic shifts, cultural trends, consumer attitudes, and lifestyle changes.
4. **Technological**: Innovation, automation, R&D activity, and technological disruption.
5. **Environmental**: Sustainability, climate change, carbon footprint, and resource scarcity.
6. **Legal**: Employment laws, consumer protection laws, health and safety, and industry regulations.
