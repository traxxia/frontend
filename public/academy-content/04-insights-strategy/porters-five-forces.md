# Porter's Five Forces

Porter's Five Forces is a strategic framework that helps you understand the competitive dynamics of your industry. Traxxia automatically generates this analysis based on your questionnaire responses.

## The Five Forces

Developed by Michael Porter, this framework analyzes:

1. **Threat of New Entrants**: How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market?
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: How much leverage do your suppliers have over you?
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: How much control do your customers have over your pricing?
4. **Threat of Substitutes**: How easily can customers switch to an alternative solution?
5. **Competitive Rivalry**: How intense is the competition among existing players?

## Understanding the Ratings

Traxxia rates each force on a scale of 1-10:
- **Low (1-3)**: Favorable to your business.
- **Medium (4-6)**: Neutral competitive force.
- **High (7-10)**: Challenging for your business.

## Strategic Implications

- If **Competitive Rivalry** is high, you must focus on extreme differentiation.
- If **Buyer Power** is high, you need to build strong brand loyalty and switching costs.
- If **Threat of New Entrants** is high, focus on securing proprietary technology or exclusive distribution.

> [!NOTE] Even in an "unattractive" industry where most forces are high, individual companies can succeed through superior strategic positioning.
