## 1. Product-Market Fit (PMF) Validation
A key feature of the Phase 3 Essential tier is the **PMF Flow**. The insights generated here help you determine:
-   **Target Audience**: Who is your ideal customer?
-   **Value Proposition**: Why should they choose you over competitors?
-   **Market Positioning**: Where do you fit in the current landscape?

## 2. Deep Analytical Frameworks
Beyond the PMF flow, Traxxia provides established strategic frameworks derived directly from your data:

-   [Porter's Five Forces](./porters-five-forces.md)
-   [Financial Analysis Overview](./financial-analysis.md)

## 3. Strategic Themes & Initiatives
The AI identifies recurring themes and suggests specific **Strategic Initiatives**. On the **Essential Plan**, you can generate unlimited initiatives to refine your strategy, even if you cannot yet convert them into active projects.
