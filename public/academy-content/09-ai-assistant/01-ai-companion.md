# The AI Assistant

Your **AI Assistant** is more than just a chatbot—it is a continuous data companion that lives within both your business and project views to provide real-time intelligence.

## 1. Contextual Intelligence
The AI Assistant is aware of where you are in the application:
-   **Dashboard View**: Provides high-level business advice and helps you navigate the platform.
-   **Project Edit View**: Automatically receives the current **Project ID**, allowing it to answer specific questions about that initiative’s goals, risks, and descriptions.

## 2. Dynamic Suggestions
Based on the field you are editing or the phase you are in, the AI will suggest questions like:
-   "Help me refine the project description."
-   "What risks should I consider for this initiative?"
-   "Suggest success metrics for this strategic bet."

## 3. History Persistence
Your conversation history is unified across the session. You can start a chat on the Dashboard and continue it inside a Project page without losing the thread of your conversation.

> [!TIP]
> Use the AI as a "sparring partner" to challenge your strategic assumptions and help you write more professional business descriptions.
