## What is Project Management in Traxxia?

- **Prioritizing Initiatives**: Rank projects using custom ranking models
- **Tracking Progress**: Monitor project status and milestones
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign project owners and collaborators

## When Projects Unlock

### Business Lifecycle:

**Phase 1: Analysis (under business accordion)**
- Complete questionnaire
- Generate strategic analyses  
- Upload financial data
- **No projects yet** - focus on understanding the business

**Phase 2: Projects (under project phase accordion)**
- Create your first project
- Business card automatically turns blue
- Focus shifts from analysis to execution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating your first project transitions the business from "Analysis" phase to "Projects" phase. This is a one-way transition signaling you're moving from planning to doing.

## Project Ranking & Prioritization

### Why Rank Projects?

With limited resources, you can't do everything. Ranking helps:
- Identify highest-impact initiatives
- Allocate resources strategically
- Sequence projects logically
- Communicate priorities to team

### Traxxia's Ranking System:

**Ranking Models**:
Traxxia provides multiple ranking frameworks:
1. **Effort vs. Impact**: Classic 2x2 matrix
2. **Strategic Fit**: Alignment with business goals
3. **Risk vs. Reward**: Evaluate risk tolerance
4. **ROI Ranking**: Financial return focus
5. **Urgency vs. Importance**: Eisenhower Matrix

### How to Rank:

1. Create multiple projects
2. Click "Rank Projects" button
3. Select ranking model
4. Score each project on criteria
5. View prioritized list

## Team Collaboration on Projects

### Project Roles:

**Org Admin**:
- Primary person responsible
- Accountable for delivery
- Updates status and progress

**Collaborators**:
- All business collaborators can view projects
- Can comment and contribute
- Cannot edit unless given permissions



## Project Best Practices

### 1. SMART Projects

Make projects:
- **Specific**: "Launch AI consulting" not "Improve business"
- **Measurable**: Include success metrics  
- **Achievable**: Realistic scope
- **Relevant**: Tied to strategic goals
- **Time-bound**: Set deadlines

### 2. Strategic Alignment

Every project should connect to:
- SWOT insight
- Strategic framework finding
- Clear business objective
- Measurable outcome

**Bad Project**: "General marketing improvements"  
**Good Project**: "Launch content marketing program to address brand awareness weakness, targeting 50 new leads/month"

### 3. Right-Size Projects

**Too Big**: "Complete digital transformation"  
**Too Small**: "Update website footer"

**Just Right**: "Implement CRM system for sales team (Q2 2024)"

### 4. Limit WIP (Work in Progress)

Don't start too many projects simultaneously:
- **Small Team (<10)**: 2-3 active projects max
- **Medium Team (10-50)**: 5-8 active projects
- **Large Team (50+)**: 10-15 active projects

Focus beats diffusion.

## Linking Projects to Analyses

### How Projects Connect:

**Strategic Analysis**:
- SWOT generates insights
- Insights suggest projects
- Projects address strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats

**Financial Analysis**:
- Financial metrics reveal trends
- Projects improve key metrics
- Track project ROI

**Example Flow**:
1. SWOT identifies weakness: "Manual processes slow customer onboarding"
2. Create project: "Implement Automated Onboarding System"
3. Financial analysis shows: Customer acquisition cost = $500
4. Project goal: Reduce CAC to $300 through automation

## Common Questions

**Q: How many projects should I create?**  
A: Quality over quantity. Start with 3-5 high-impact projects. You can always add more.

**Q: Can I delete a project?**  
A: Yes. Click the project and select "Delete." This is permanent and cannot be undone.

**Q: What happens when I complete a project?**  
A: Mark it "Completed" to track it as finished. It remains visible for reference but can be archived.

**Q: Can projects span multiple businesses?**  
A: No. Projects belong to one business. Create separate projects in each business if needed.

**Q: Does Traxxia have Gantt charts or detailed task management?**  
A: Not currently. Traxxia focuses on strategic project identification and prioritization. Use dedicated project management tools (Asana, Jira, etc.) for detailed execution tracking.

## Phase Transition: Analysis → Projects

### What Changes:

**Visual**:
- Transition happens when the **orgadmin** clicks the kickstart project button in the strategic tab.
- "Projects" tab becomes primary focus

**Mindset Shift**:
- From "Understanding the business"
- To "Executing strategy"

**Workflow**:
- Update questionnaire as business evolves
- Regenerate strategic analyses periodically
- Create new projects from updated insights
- Track project progress

> [!TIP]
> You can still update the questionnaire and regenerate analyses even after creating projects. Strategic planning is ongoing, not one-time.
