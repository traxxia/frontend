## What is Project Management in Traxxia?

Project Management connects strategy to execution by:
- **Creating Strategic Projects**: Turn SWOT insights and strategic analyses into concrete initiatives
- **Prioritizing Initiatives**: Rank projects using manual and AI-assisted ranking
- **Tracking Progress**: Monitor project status through the full lifecycle
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign project owners and collaborators, gather team rankings

## When Projects Unlock

### Business Lifecycle:

**Phase 1: Analysis (under business accordion)**
- Complete questionnaire
- Generate strategic analyses  
- Upload financial data
- **No projects yet** - focus on understanding the business

**Phase 2: Projects (under project phase accordion)**
- Create your first project
- Business card automatically turns blue
- Focus shifts from analysis to execution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating your first project transitions the business from "Analysis" phase to "Projects" phase. This is a one-way transition signaling you're moving from planning to doing.

## Creating a Project

### Two methods to create a project:

**Method 1:** Kickstart project button in the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab (first time only — Company Admins only).  
**Method 2:** "New Project" button in the Projects tab.

### Project Fields:

**Strategic Core** (the heart of the project):
- **Project Name**: Clear, specific title
- **Description**: What the project accomplishes
- **Why This Matters**: The strategic rationale
- **Strategic Bet**: The key strategic decision or hypothesis being tested
- **Accountable Owner**: Who's responsible for execution
- **Impact**: High / Medium / Low
- **Key Assumptions to Test**: Bullet-point list of assumptions that must hold true
- **Continue If**: Success criteria — when to keep going
- **Stop If**: Kill criteria — when to stop the project
- **Status**: Draft / Active / At Risk / Paused / Killed / Scaled
- **Learning State**: Testing / Validated / Invalidated
- **Review Cadence**: How frequently the project is reviewed

**Strategic Context**:
- **Impact**: High / Medium / Low
- **Effort**: Small / Medium / Large
- **Risk**: Low / Medium / High
- **Strategic Theme**: Growth / Efficiency / Innovation / Customer Experience / Risk Mitigation / Platform

**Additional Details**:
- **Constraints / Non-Negotiables**: Hard limits on the project
- **Dependencies**: What this project depends on
- **Explicitly Out of Scope**: What is excluded
- **Expected Outcome**: What success looks like
- **Success Metrics**: How success is measured
- **Estimated Timeline**: Rough duration
- **Budget Estimate**: Estimated cost

## Projects Dashboard View

### UI Layout:

The Projects tab has two top-level views toggled by tabs at the top:

- **Projects tab**: Shows the project card grid with status filter tabs (All / Draft / Active / At Risk / Paused / Killed / Scaled) and action buttons (New Project, Launch)
- **Ranking tab**: Shows the ranking panel and team rankings view

**Project Card**:
- Project name and description
- Color-coded badges for Impact, Effort, Risk, and Strategic Theme
- Status badge
- Strategic Decision (Strategic Bet) text
- Quick actions (view, edit, delete via 3-dot menu)
- Checkbox for selecting projects to launch (Admin only)

## Project Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Draft** | Being defined — not yet in execution |
| **Active** | Currently being worked on |
| **At Risk** | Active but facing challenges |
| **Paused** | Temporarily suspended |
| **Killed** | Discontinued — no longer viable |
| **Scaled** | Successfully expanded beyond initial scope |

## Project Ranking & Prioritization

### Why Rank Projects?

With limited resources, you can't do everything. Ranking helps:
- Identify highest-impact initiatives
- Allocate resources strategically
- Sequence projects logically
- Communicate priorities to team

### How to Rank:

1. Switch to the **Ranking** tab in the Projects section
2. Use the **Rank Projects** panel to drag-and-drop or assign ranks
3. Save your rankings — AI re-ranking is automatically triggered after saving
4. View the **Rankings View** to see all collaborators' rankings side by side

### AI Re-Ranking:

After you save manual rankings, Traxxia automatically calls the AI ranking engine to generate an objective AI ranking. This AI ranking is shown alongside manual rankings so you can compare human intuition with AI analysis.

## Team Collaboration on Projects

### Project Roles:

**Company Admin / Super Admin**:
- Create, edit, delete any project
- Lock project creation (moves business to "Prioritizing" phase)
- Finalize prioritization
- Launch projects
- View collaborator ranking progress

**Collaborators**:
- Create and edit their own projects (in Draft status)
- Rank projects
- Lock their own rankings
- View all projects

**Viewers**:
- View projects only — no editing or ranking

### Collaborator Ranking Progress:

Admins can see a **Collaborator Progress** badge (e.g., "2 / 3") showing how many collaborators have locked their rankings. A green checkmark appears when all collaborators have locked.

## Project Best Practices

### 1. SMART Projects

Make projects:
- **Specific**: "Launch AI consulting" not "Improve business"
- **Measurable**: Include success metrics  
- **Achievable**: Realistic scope
- **Relevant**: Tied to strategic goals
- **Time-bound**: Set deadlines

### 2. Strategic Alignment

Every project should connect to:
- SWOT insight
- Strategic framework finding
- Clear business objective
- Measurable outcome

### 3. Use Key Assumptions

Fill in the **Key Assumptions to Test** field to make your strategic bets explicit. This forces clarity on what must be true for the project to succeed, and makes it easier to know when to stop.

### 4. Limit WIP (Work in Progress)

Don't start too many projects simultaneously:
- **Small Team (<10)**: 2-3 active projects max
- **Medium Team (10-50)**: 5-8 active projects
- **Large Team (50+)**: 10-15 active projects

Focus beats diffusion.

## Phase Transition: Analysis → Projects

### What Changes:

**Visual**:
- Transition happens when the **Company Admin** clicks the Kickstart Projects button in the S.T.R.A.T.E.G.I.C tab.
- "Projects" tab becomes primary focus

**Mindset Shift**:
- From "Understanding the business"
- To "Executing strategy"

**Workflow**:
- Update questionnaire as business evolves
- Regenerate strategic analyses periodically
- Create new projects from updated insights
- Track project progress

> [!TIP]
> You can still update the questionnaire and regenerate analyses even after creating projects. Strategic planning is ongoing, not one-time.
