# Project Category & Statuses

Understanding the status of your projects is crucial for effective management and strategic alignment. In Traxxia, every project is assigned a status that indicates its current stage in the lifecycle.

## Project Statuses Explained

These statuses help you track progress and communicate the health of your initiatives at a glance.

### 1. Draft
**The "Planning" Phase.**
Projects in **Draft** are currently being defined. They may have a name and owner but are not yet ready for execution. This is the stage where you refine the scope, description, and initial prioritization.

### 2. Active
**The "Execution" Phase.**
An **Active** project is currently being worked on. Resources are allocated, and the project owner is actively driving toward the defined milestones. This is the primary state for initiatives in progress.

### 3. At Risk
**The "Alert" Phase.**
Projects marked as **At Risk** are still active but facing significant challenges. This could be due to budget overruns, missed deadlines, resource constraints, or strategic shifts. This status signals that intervention or support may be needed.

### 4. Paused
**The "Hold" Phase.**
A **Paused** project is temporarily suspended. Work is not currently progressing, but the project is not cancelled. This usually happens when priorities shift or when waiting for external dependencies or decisions.

### 5. Killed
**The "Discontinued" Phase.**
A project is **Killed** when it is determined that it no longer aligns with the strategy, has become unfeasible, or is no longer required. Killing a project is a valid strategic decision to free up resources for higher-impact initiatives.
