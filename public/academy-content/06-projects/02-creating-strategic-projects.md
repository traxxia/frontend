# Creating Strategic Projects

A practical guide to translating strategic insights into well-defined, actionable projects in Traxxia.

---

## Project Fundamentals

### What Makes a Good Strategic Project?

A strategic project should be:
- **Specific**: Clear scope and outcome
- **Strategic**: Tied to business goals
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Actionable**: Can actually be executed
- **Time-bound**: Has defined timeline

---

## Project Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Source from Strategic Analysis

**Best Practice**: Don't create random projects. Extract them from:
- SWOT Analysis insights
- PESTEL findings
- Porter's Five Forces implications
- Financial analysis gaps
- Competitive landscape opportunities

**Example Flow**:
```
SWOT Weakness: "Limited brand awareness"
→ Strategic Implication: Need marketing investment
→ PROJECT: "Brand Awareness Campaign Q2 2024"
```

---

### Step 2: Define Project Clearly

**Project Name** (Required):
- Max 100 characters
- Descriptive and specific
- Includes timeframe if relevant

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Launch SaaS Platform MVP - Q3 2024"
- ✅ "Reduce Customer Churn to <8%"
- ✅ "Enter European Market - Germany Focus"
- ❌ "Marketing stuff"
- ❌ "Improve the business"

---

**Project Description** (Required):
- What: What will be accomplished
- Why: Strategic rationale
- How: Highлevel approach
- Success: Measurable outcomes

**Template**:
```
WHAT: [Deliverable/outcome]
WHY: [Strategic reason from SWOT/analysis]
HOW: [High-level approach]
SUCCESS: [Measurable criteria]
```

**Example**:
```
WHAT: Launch a content marketing program targeting CFOs
WHY: SWOT identified weakness in brand awareness among target audience
HOW: Create 20 thought leadership articles, 10 webinars, LinkedIn ad campaign
SUCCESS: 50 qualified leads/month, 10% website traffic increase
```

---

### Step 3: Assign Ownership

**Project Owner** (Required):
- Select from business collaborators
- Person accountable for delivery
- Typically the executor, not just sponsor

**Tips**:
- Choose based on expertise
- Ensure owner has capacity
- Get their buy-in first
- One owner per project (accountability)

---

### Step 4: Set Timeline

**Start Date** (Optional but Recommended):
- When work actually begins
- Not when you create the project
- Consider dependencies

**End Date** (Optional but Recommended):
- Realistic completion target
- Build in buffer for unknowns
- Align with business milestones

**Best Practice**: Set dates even if tentative. Forces planning.

---

### Step 5: Estimate Budget

**Budget** (Optional):
- Total estimated cost
- Include all resources (people, tools, services)
- Helps prioritize and resource allocation

**When to Include**:
- Financial impact is significant
- Need approval/allocation
- Comparing project ROI

---

### Step 6: Set Status & Priority

**Status**:
- Not Started (default for new projects)
- In Progress
- Completed
- On Hold
- Cancelled

**Priority**:
- High: Critical, time-sensitive
- Medium: Important, normal timeline
- Low: Nice-to-have, flexible timing

## Common Project Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Vague

**Bad**: "Improve marketing"

**Good**: "Launch account-based marketing program targeting Fortune 500 CFOs, generating 30 qualified enterprise leads per quarter"

---

### Mistake 2: No Clear Success Criteria

**Bad**: "Better customer service"

**Good**: "Reduce support ticket resolution time from 48hrs to 24hrs, increasing CSAT from 3.2 to 4.5/5.0"

---

### Mistake 3: No Strategic Link

**Bad**: Creating projects randomly without connecting to SWOT/analysis

**Good**: Every project explicitly addresses a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, or Threat

---

### Mistake 4: Unrealistic Scope

**Bad**: "Complete digital transformation in 3 months"

**Good**: "Phase 1: Implement CRM (Q1), Phase 2: Automate email marketing (Q2), Phase 3: E-commerce platform (Q3-Q4)"

---

### Mistake 5: Wrong Owner

**Bad**: Assigning to CEO or someone too busy

**Good**: Assigning to person with expertise, availability, and authority to execute

---

## Project Granularity

### Too Big (Should Be Multiple Projects):
- "Launch new business unit"
- "Complete digital transformation"
-"Solve all our problems"

### Too Small (Should Be Tasks):
- "Update website footer"
- "Send customer email"
- "Book conference room"

### Just Right:
- "Launch MVP SaaS Platform"
- "Expand to EMEA Market"
- "Implement Marketing Automation"
- "Hire and Onboard Sales Team"

**Rule of Thumb**: If project takes <1 week or >1 year, reconsider scope

---

## Linking to Strategic Analysis

### From SWOT to Projects:

**Strength → Leverage**:
- Strength: "Patented technology"
- Project: "Expand licensing program to 10 new partners"

**Weakness → Fix**:
- Weakness: "Slow product development (18mo cycle)"
- Project: "Implement agile methodology, reduce cycle to 12mo"

**Opportunity → Pursue**:
- Opportunity: "Competitor exited mid-market"
- Project: "Mid-market sales blitz targeting former customers"

**Threat → Defend**:
- Threat: "Regulatory change increasing costs"
- Project: "Compliance automation system to offset 50% of cost increase"

---

## Project Portfolio Balance

### Diversify Project Types:

**Quick Wins** (30-40%):
- High impact, low effort
- Build momentum
- Show results fast

**Major Initiatives** (30-40%):
- High impact, high effort
- Strategic bets
- Long-term value

**Defensive** (20-30%):
- Address threats and weaknesses
- Protect existing business
- Risk mitigation

**Innovation** (10-20%):
- Experimental
- Future positioning
- Calculate risks

---

## After Creating a Project

### What Happens:

1. **Business Transitions**: First project → Business card turns blue (Analysis → Projects phase)

2. **Project Appears**: In Projects tab list

3. **Ready to Rank**: Can be included in prioritization ranking

4. **Team Visibility**: All collaborators can see the project

---

## Project Collaboration

### Communicating with Team:

**In Project Description**:
- Clear objectives and success criteria
- Strategic context (link to SWOT/analysis)
- High-level approach

**Outside Traxxia**:
- Use dedicated project management tools (Asana, Jira, etc.) for detailed task tracking
- Regular status meetings
- Documentation in shared drives

> [!NOTE]
> Traxxia focuses on strategic project identification and prioritization, not detailed task management. Export to external tools for execution tracking.
