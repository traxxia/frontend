# Project Information & Fields (Overview)

Once an initiative is kickstarted, it enters the **Projects Section**. This is where you refine the details of your strategic bets.

## 1. Project States
Every project follows a specific lifecycle:
-   **Status: Draft**: The project is being defined and refined. Consensual ranking happens in this stage.
-   **Learning State: Testing**: Indicates that the project's assumptions are currently being validated through the Traxxia methodology.

## 2. Understanding Project Fields
When you view or edit a project, you will encounter several key fields used by the AI to help you prioritize:
-   **Elevator Pitch**: A one-sentence summary of the project's value.
-   **Strategic Decision**: How this project aligns with your core strategic goals.
-   **Impact**: The potential benefit to the business (ranked from Low to High).
-   **Effort**: The resources and time required to execute (ranked from Low to High).
-   **Risk**: Potential obstacles or uncertainties.
-   **Success Metrics**: Clear KPIs that will prove the project was successful.

## 3. The Project List
The Projects page offers a tabular and card-based view of all your initiatives. You can filter by:
-   **Status**: Draft or Active.
-   **Theme**: Group projects by their strategic origin.
-   **Ranking**: Sort by consensus or individual developer ranking.

> [!TIP] Use the AI Assistant on the project edit page to help you write better descriptions and identify hidden risks.
