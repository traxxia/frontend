# Editing Projects

Maintaining and updating your project details is essential as strategic plans evolve. This article covers how to edit project information and the rules governing these changes.

## How to Edit a Project

Team members with appropriate permissions can edit projects directly from the Project Dashboard:

1.  Navigate to the **Projects** tab.
2.  Locate the project you wish to modify.
3.  Click the **"Edit"** icon (pencil) on the project card or within the project detail view.
4.  Update the necessary fields (e.g., Description, Timeline, Resources).
5.  Click **"Save Changes"** to apply updates.

## Editable Fields

Most fields can be updated during the project's lifecycle, including:

- **Project Description**: A clear, concise summary of what the project aims to achieve.
- **Why This Matters**: The strategic rationale or "the why" behind the project—how it creates value.
- **Strategic Decision / Bet**: The specific strategic choice or hypothesis this project is testing.
- **Accountable Owner**: The individual responsible for the project's success and progress.
- **Key Assumptions Tested**: The critical uncertainties that this project aims to validate or invalidate.
- **Continue If (Success Criteria)**: Specific conditions or milestones that justify further investment.
- **Stop If (Kill Criteria)**: Predetermined triggers that indicate the project should be deprioritized or terminated.
- **Review Cadence**: How often the project state and metrics are reviewed (e.g., Weekly, Monthly).
- **Status**: The current lifecycle stage of the project (e.g., Backlog, Active, Completed).
- **Learning State**: What has been discovered so far relative to the key assumptions.
- **Impact**: The expected benefit to the organization (often scored significantly).
- **Effort**: The estimated resources and time required for implementation.
- **Rank**: The relative priority of this project within the broader portfolio.
- **Strategic Theme / Horizon**: Which long-term strategic category or growth horizon this project belongs to.
- **Dependencies**: Other projects, resources, or events that this project relies on.
- **Constraints / Non-Negotiables**: Fixed boundaries or requirements that the project must respect.
- **Explicitly Out of Scope**: What the project will *not* do, to prevent scope creep.
- **Expected Outcome**: The ultimate result or change in state anticipated upon completion.
- **Success Metrics (KPIs)**: Quantifiable indicators used to measure project effectiveness.
- **Estimated Timeline**: The planned start and end dates for the project.
- **Budget Estimate**: The financial resources allocated or required for the initiative.


## Editing Restrictions

To maintain data integrity, certain restrictions apply:
- **Locked Projects**: Projects in "Prioritization" phase or "Active" status may have restricted editing to prevent unauthorized changes to finalized plans.
- **Audit Logs**: All significant changes are recorded in the project's activity history for transparency.
