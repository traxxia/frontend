# Team Collaboration

Strategy is a team sport. Traxxia allows you to bring your colleagues into the analysis process to build consensus and leverage diverse perspectives.

## 1. Plan Requirement
Collaboration is strictly an **Advanced Plan** feature. The **Essential Tier** is designed for individual owner-CEOs and has **0 collaborator seats**.

## 2. Included Collaborator Seats
In Phase 3, the Advanced Plan includes **3 Collaborator Invites** in its base price. This allows for a total team size of **4 users** (1 Admin + 3 Collaborators).

> [!NOTE] For Phase 3, the ability to add more than 3 collaborator seats is not yet supported. All Advanced accounts are capped at this base team size.

## 3. Inviting Team Members
As a Company Admin on the Advanced plan:
-   Access the **User Management** section in your Admin Panel.
-   Create 3 collaborators.
-   Assign them to your active businesses.

**Why Collaboration?** Attempting to add a team member while on the Essential plan will trigger an upgrade modal, as this feature is the primary driver for turning "Insights" into "Execution."
