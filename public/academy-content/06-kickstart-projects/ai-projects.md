# AI-Driven Project Creation

As said When you are satisfied with a strategic theme or initiative suggested by the AI, you can "Kickstart" it to transform it into a formal project.

## From where the Projects Are Created

Projects are primarily birthed in the **Strategic Dashboard** (Phase 3: alignment). After the AI has generated strategic themes, initiatives, or "Winning Aspirations," these concepts exist as high-level strategic units.

### The Kickstart Mechanism
The "Kickstart" button is the bridge between strategy and project management. the strategic initiative that you want to transform into a project are:

1.  Immediate Actions.
2.  Short-term Initiatives.
3.  Long-term Initiatives.

> [!TIP]
> Use the AI Companion within the project view to refine milestones or generate more detailed sub-tasks if the initial breakdown needs more granularity.
