# Kickstarting Initiatives

When you are satisfied with a strategic theme or initiative suggested by the AI, you can "Kickstart" it to transform it into a formal project.

## 1. Execution Gating
A crucial distinction in Phase 3 is the split between **Insight** (Essential) and **Execution** (Advanced):
-   **Essential Users**: Can generate unlimited strategic initiatives but **cannot** convert them into projects. The Kickstart button is replaced with an "Upgrade to Execute" call-to-action.
-   **Advanced Users**: Have full access to the complete project lifecycle, including kickstarting and monitoring.

## 2. The Upgrade Trigger
When you finish a strategic plan or initiative in the Essential tier, Traxxia will prompt you to upgrade. This is the logical moment to transition from purely thinking about strategy to actually managing its delivery.

## 3. From Thinking to Doing
For Advanced users, clicking Kickstart moves the initiative from the **Strategy Engine** into the **Project Management Module**.

-   **Locked for Essential**: Project Kickoff, Monitoring, Maintenance, and Health Tracking.
-   **Unlocked for Advanced**: Complete visibility and rigor throughout the project lifecycle.

> [!IMPORTANT] A minimum of **one collaborator** is required for Advanced users to kickstart a project, ensuring a collaborative "sanity check" before execution begins.
