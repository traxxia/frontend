- Operations: Value chain, supplier questions

#### 2. Coordinate to Avoid Conflicts
- Assign question modules to specific people
- Communicate before overwriting answers

### Regenerating with Feedback:

## Communication Best Practices

### Inside Traxxia:

## Common Collaboration Challenges

### Challenge 1: Conflicting Answers

**Problem**: Two people answer same question differently

**Solution**:
- Most recent answer wins
- Discuss offline to reach consensus
- Update with agreed-upon answer
- Consider creating hybrid answer

---

### Challenge 2: Overwriting Work

**Problem**: Someone rewrites another's detailed answer

**Solution**:
- Assign question modules upfront
- Communicate before major changes
- Review together before finalizing
- Use version history (if available)

---

### Challenge 3: Unequal Contribution

**Problem**: Some collaborators contribute more than others

**Solution**:
- Set clear expectations upfront
- Assign specific responsibilities
- Set deadlines for contributions
- Remove non-participants

---

### Challenge 4: Too Many Collaborators

**Problem**: 10+ people cause coordination chaos

**Solution**:
- Limit to 3-5 core collaborators
- Add others as Viewers
- Designate "answer approver" role
- Use working groups for specific modules

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Right-Size the Team

**Too Few** (1 person):
- Risk of blind spots
- Limited perspectives
- Potentially biased

**Too Many** (10+ people):
- Coordination overhead
- Conflicting inputs
- Slow progress

**Just Right** (3-5 people):
- Diverse perspectives
- Manageable coordination
- Shared ownership

---

### 2. Clear Role Assignment

Define upfront:
- Who answers which questions
- Who owns which projects
- Who has approval authority
- Who facilitates reviews

---

### 3. Regular Sync-Ups

**During Questionnaire**: Weekly to review progress

**During Analysis**: Meeting to review SWOT/frameworks together

**During Projects**: Bi-weekly to update status and priorities

---

### 4. Document Decisions

Use business description/project descriptions to capture:
- Strategic decisions made
- Rationale for choices
- Assumptions and constraints
- Success criteria

---

## Collaboration Across Multiple Businesses

### If Your Team Works on Multiple Businesses:

**Option A: Separate Teams**
- Each business has dedicated collaborators
- Clear ownership and focus
- Avoids confusion

**Option B: Core Team**
- Same collaborators across all businesses
- Consistent methodology
- Potential overload

**Hybrid** (Recommended):
- Core team (2-3) across all
- Domain experts added per business
- Balance consistency and expertise
