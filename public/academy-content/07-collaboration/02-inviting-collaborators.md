## Before You Invite

### Determine Who to Invite:

**Consider inviting**:
- Domain experts for specific questionnaire modules
- Stakeholders who need to review strategy
- Project owners for execution
- Team members who bring diverse perspectives

**Questions to Ask**:
- Who has critical knowledge for answering questions?
- Who needs to approve the strategy?
- Who will execute projects?
- Who benefits from visibility?

---

### Choose the Right Role:

If you're a **Super Admin** or **Company Admin**, you can assign roles:

| When to Assign | Role | Access Level |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| Full partner in planning | Collaborator | Edit access |
| Just needs visibility | Viewer | Read-only |
| Company leadership | Company Admin | Full company access |

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a Collaborator yourself, invitees inherit appropriate permissions based on their organization role.

## Invitation Best Practices

### 1. Invite Early for Input

**Good Timing**:
- Before completing questionnaire (get diverse answers)
- During strategic planning (collaborative analysis)
- When creating projects (identify owners)

**Too Late**:
- After everything is done (no value-add)
- For visibility only (consider Viewer role instead)

---



### 3. Assign Responsibilities

**Avoid**: "Everyone do everything" (leads to duplication and gaps)

**Instead**:
- Specific question modules per person
- Clear project ownership
- Designated reviewers
- Single approver for final decisions

---

### 4. Limit Invites

**Optimal**: 3-5 core collaborators

**Too Many**: 10+ people (coordination overhead)

**Strategy**:
- Core team: Collaborator role (3-5 people)
- Stakeholders: Viewer role (unlimited)
- Execution team: Add as needed for specific projects

---
