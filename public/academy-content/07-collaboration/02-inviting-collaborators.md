A step-by-step guide to inviting team members to collaborate on your Traxxia business analysis and strategic planning.

---

## Before You Invite

### Determine Who to Invite:

**Consider inviting**:
- Domain experts for specific questionnaire modules
- Stakeholders who need to review strategy
- Project owners for execution
- Team members who bring diverse perspectives

**Questions to Ask**:
- Who has critical knowledge for answering questions?
- Who needs to approve the strategy?
- Who will execute projects?
- Who benefits from visibility?

---

### Choose the Right Role:

If you're a **Super Admin** or **Company Admin**, you can assign roles:

| When to Assign | Role | Access Level |
|----------------|------|--------------|
| Full partner in planning | Collaborator | Edit access |
| Just needs visibility | Viewer | Read-only |
| Company leadership | Company Admin | Full company access |

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a Collaborator yourself, invitees inherit appropriate permissions based on their organization role.

## Managing Collaborators

### Viewing Collaborator List:

2. Navigate to "Collaboration" or settings
3. View all invited users
4. See their role, status, and last activity

**Information Displayed**:
- Name and email
- Role (Viewer, Collaborator, Admin)
- Status (Pending, Active)
- Date invited
- Last active (optional)

---

### Resending Invitations:

If someone didn't receive the email:
1. Find them in collaborators list
2. Look for "Resend Invitation" button
3. Click to send another email

**When to Resend**:
- Invitee says they didn't get email
- Email went to spam
- Invitation expired (if applicable)
- Original email address was typo

---

### Removing Collaborators:

**When to Remove**:
- Person leaves organization
- No longer needs access
- Invited by mistake
- Role changing (re-invite with new role)

**How to Remove**:
1. Navigate to collaborators list
2. Find user to remove
3. Click "Remove" or trash icon
4. Confirm removal

**Impact of Removal**:
✅ Immediate: Loses access to business  
✅ Business disappears from their dashboard  
✅ Can no longer view or edit  
⚠ Their previous contributions remain (answers, projects)  
⚠ If they own projects, you may need to reassign

> [!WARNING]
> Removing a collaborator is immediate and cannot be undone. They must be re-invited to regain access.

## Invitation Best Practices

### 1. Invite Early for Input

**Good Timing**:
- Before completing questionnaire (get diverse answers)
- During strategic planning (collaborative analysis)
- When creating projects (identify owners)

**Too Late**:
- After everything is done (no value-add)
- For visibility only (consider Viewer role instead)

---

### 2. Set Expectations

When inviting, communicate:
- **Why** they're being invited (expertise, ownership, review)
- **What** you need from them (answer X questions, review SWOT, own Y project)
- **When** you need their input (deadline)
- **How** to get started (login, navigate to business)

**Example Email**:
```
Hi Sarah,

I've invited you to collaborate on our "EMEA Market Entry" business 
in Traxxia. I need your expertise on the competitive landscape 
questions (Module 3) and would love your input on the SWOT analysis.

Please log in to Traxxia and you'll see the business in your dashboard. 
Let's aim to have the questionnaire done by end of week so we can 
review the analysis together next Monday.

Thanks!
```

### 3. Assign Responsibilities

**Avoid**: "Everyone do everything" (leads to duplication and gaps)

**Instead**:
- Specific question modules per person
- Clear project ownership
- Designated reviewers
- Single approver for final decisions

---

### 4. Limit Invites

**Optimal**: 3-5 core collaborators

**Too Many**: 10+ people (coordination overhead)

**Strategy**:
- Core team: Collaborator role (3-5 people)
- Stakeholders: Viewer role (unlimited)
- Execution team: Add as needed for specific projects

---
