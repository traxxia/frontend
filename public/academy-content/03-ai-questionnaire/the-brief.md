# The Brief: Your Business Profile

"The Brief" is a dynamic, living profile of your business within Traxxia. It distills your answers from the AI Questionnaire into a single, comprehensive view that informs all subsequent analysis and strategic recommendations.

## What is The Brief?

Think of The Brief as your organization's "source of truth." As you interact with the AI Assistant and complete the questionnaire phases, the Brief automatically populates with your strategic data, including:
- Your core business purpose and activities.
- Target audience and product/service offerings.
- Market positioning and competitive landscape details.
- Internal capabilities and resource constraints.

## Editing Your Profile

The Brief is not just a static summary—it is fully interactive. To ensure your analysis remains accurate as your business evolves, you can edit any entry directly within the Brief section.

1.  **Locate the Entry**: Find the specific answer you wish to update.
2.  **Click to Edit**: Small "Edit" icons appear next to entries you have permission to modify.
3.  **Update and Save**: Make your changes and click **"Save"**.
4.  **Auto-Save**: The system also includes auto-save functionality for long responses to prevent data loss.

## Responding to Missing Questions

When you attempt to generate advanced insights (like a SWOT Analysis or PESTEL), the system may identify that critical information is missing from your Brief.

- **Missing Question Highlights**: Required fields will be highlighted in **orange**.
- **Banner Alerts**: A banner at the top of the Brief will list exactly which questions need more detail.
- **Improved Analysis**: Filling these gaps ensures the AI has enough context to provide high-quality, actionable insights.

## Progress Tracking

The Brief section includes a progress bar that shows how much of your business profile is complete across the various phases:
- **Initial Phase**: Core onboarding questions.
- **Essential Phase**: Broad context and strategic foundations.
- **Good/Advanced Phases**: Deep financial and competitive data.
