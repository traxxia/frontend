# PMF Flow

The Product-Market Fit (PMF) Flow is the core engine of Traxxia's strategic value. It ensures that users can move from raw data to clear strategic priorities and execution in under 15 minutes.

## The One Product Objective

Traxxia succeeds only if:
1. A strategy professional reaches **clear priorities and next actions in under 15 minutes**.
2. They return **weekly** to update execution.

### We are NOT optimizing for:
*   Analytical depth
*   Completeness
*   Explainability

### We ARE optimizing for:
*   **Recognition**: Users immediately identify their reality in the data.
*   **Clarity**: No ambiguity in what needs to be done.
*   **Return Behavior**: The product becomes a weekly habit for execution.
