# PMF Flow

The Product-Market Fit (PMF) Flow is the core engine of Traxxia's strategic value. It ensures that users can move from raw data to clear strategic priorities and execution in under 15 minutes.

## The One Product Objective

2. They return **weekly** to update execution.

*   **Recognition**: Users immediately identify their reality in the data.
*   **Clarity**: No ambiguity in what needs to be done.
