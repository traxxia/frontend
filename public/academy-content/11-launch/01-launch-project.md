# Launch Project

Launching a project signals the official start of execution across the organization.

## 1. Access Control

Only Company Admins and Super Admins can launch projects.

## 2. How to Launch

Projects are launched from the **Projects tab** (not the Ranking tab).

1. In the Projects view, **check the checkbox** on one or more project cards to select them
2. A **Launch (N)** button (purple) appears in the top-right action bar
3. Click **Launch** to proceed

## 3. Single vs. Multiple Project Launch

Traxxia applies different rules depending on how many projects you are launching:

### Single Project Launch
- **Rankings are bypassed** — the project is automatically assigned rank #1
- No need for collaborators to lock their rankings first
- The project launches immediately

### Multiple Project Launch
- All collaborators **must have locked their rankings** before the admin can launch
- If any collaborator has not yet locked their ranking, the launch will be blocked with an error message
- Once all collaborators have locked, the admin can select and launch multiple projects

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Killed projects **cannot be launched**. If your selection includes a killed project, you will receive an error. Deselect killed projects before launching.

## 4. Ranking Requirement

Before launching, the selected projects must be ranked by the admin. If any selected project has no rank assigned, you will see:

> "Your projects are not ranked. Please rank them before launching."

The Ranking tab will blink to draw your attention.

## 5. After Launch

Upon clicking Launch:
*   **Business Status**: The business moves to **"Launched"** status
*   **Project Status**: Selected projects are marked as launched
*   **Edits Restricted**: Core project parameters become read-only for non-admins
*   **Ongoing Access**: Admins can still view and manage launched projects
