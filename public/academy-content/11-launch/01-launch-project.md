# Launch Project

Launching a project signals the official start of execution across the organization.

## 1. Access Control

Only the highest-level decision makers can launch a project:
*   **Organization Admins**
*   **Project Owners**

## 2. Before Launch

The project must be in a "Finalized" state. Verify that:
*   **Resources Allocated:** Budget and personnel are confirmed.
*   **Timeline Approved:** Start and end dates are set.
*   **Communication Plan:** Announcement drafts are ready.

## 3. After Launch

*   **Status Update:** Project status changes to "LAUNCHED".
*   **Notifications:** Stakeholders receive an email or in-app notification confirming the launch.
*   **Monitoring:** The project moves to the monitoring dashboard where KPIs and progress are tracked.
*   **Edits Restricted:** Core parameters cannot be changed without a formal "Reprioritization" request.
