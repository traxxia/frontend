# AI Ranking in the UI

Traxxia utilizes advanced AI to provide an objective, data-driven ranking of your project priorities, serving as a benchmark against human intuition.

## 1. How it is Displayed

The AI Ranking appears as a distinct column or overlay within the Ranking View.
*   **AI Score:** A confidence score (0-100) assigned to each item based on strategic alignment and potential impact.
*   **Rationale:** Hovering over the AI score reveals a tooltip explaining *why* the AI ranked the item that way (e.g., "High ROI potential", "Critical dependency").

## 2. Comparing AI vs. Collaborator Ranking

Administrators have access to a **"Gap Analysis"** view.
This view highlights:
*   **Overlooked Gems:** Items ranked low by the team but high by AI. These may worth reconsidering.
*   **Overhyped Features:** Items ranked high by the team but low by AI. These may be driven by bias rather than data.

Use these insights to facilitate discussion during the finalization meeting.
